v0.9.1 2012-03-15 La Forclaz (VS)
---------------------------------

- OASIS support.
- Fixed broken `Arg.pos_right`.
- Support for custom variable substitution.
- Support for custom variable substitution in `Manpage.print`.
- Variables `$(tname)` and `$(mname)` can be used in a term's man
  page to respectively refer to the term's name and the main term
  name. 

# Incompatible API changes

- The signature of `Term.eval` and `Term.eval_choice` changed to make
  it more regular: the given term and its info must be tupled together
  even for the main term and the tuple order was swapped to make it
  consistent with the one for arguments.
